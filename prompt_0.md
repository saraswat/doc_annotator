Help me make some software choices. 

I want a snappy, modern UI to allow my users to browse a collection of short (1-2 page) documents. Each document has an associated key, a pair of "name" and "date". The user should be able to select from the available names and dates using drop down lists and the main panel of the UI will then show the selected document.  Documents will be primarily text based but may have tables and charts in them. The documents themselves are generated by AI.

Note the collection of documents will be extended over time. 

There are a lot more features to be added, but let's start with just this.  For instance: users need to logged in / authenticated. The documents displayed to them will permit them to mark the document up (feedback), that will b stored under their names and date. Docum

I would prefer the code is in python. The code will be built by Claude for code and needs to be automatically managed, extended. 

What systems should I build on?

I would like the ability for the user to annotate text in the middle of the document, rather than just providing content at the end, eg as i can do in pdf with annotations. I can ask the AI generating the document to do so in html or markdown. In some cases i will only have pdf available. would it be better to do this in streamlit or un react

> For inline text annotations (like PDF annotations), you should definitely move to React rather than stay with Streamlit. Here's why and how:

please create detailed instructions for React+FastAPI approach.
